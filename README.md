# ROS-Connection-bridge
In this repository, you will find ROS1 and ROS2 packages designed for communication between hosts running different ROS distributions (ROS1 or ROS2) within the same network or over the internet. The communication is facilitated using either public or local MQTT brokers. This package enables seamless communication between different ROS distributions and currently supports Twist and String message types as illustration examples. The code can be easily modified to support additional message types for communication between ROS nodes.
